      <h2 class="card-title mt-3"> Importance of Regular Exercise</h2>
      <p>Regular exercise is crucial for maintaining good health and well-being. It not only helps in managing weight but also reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Additionally, exercise improves mood, boosts energy levels, and promotes better sleep.</p>
      
      <p>It's recommended to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week. This can include activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, swimming, and strength training.</p>
      
      <p>However, it's essential to start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts to avoid injuries. Listen to your body, and if you experience any pain or discomfort, stop exercising and consult a healthcare professional.</p>
      
      <p>Remember, consistency is key when it comes to reaping the benefits of exercise. Find activities that you enjoy and make them a part of your daily routine. Whether it's going for a walk in the park, joining a dance class, or hitting the gym, prioritize your health and make exercise a priority in your life.</p>
